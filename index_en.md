# About Japan Technical Jamboree
Japan Technical Jamboree was held by CE Linux Forum to aim to provide free technical discussion with Japan site engineers.  That was held in October 29, 2004 at first time. That been held 80 times over the past 20 years. This meeting has its origin on consumer electronics development. So we often discuss about a consumer electronics and Linux kernel and embedded systems. But we welcome any discussion about Linux and open source system.

Embedded linux was used in consumer electronics at first. In this time, that use in automotive, industry and more. Linux is much innovative, it improve in every day.
We think so, every engineer has many issue to use linux.  Japan Technical Jamboree provide discussion and communication space in Japan.  "I want to ask our issue to other engineer", "I want to present new idea to discuss with other engineer", it's ok for us.
